    abstract = {In this paper, several novel methods of improving the memory lo- cality of the
    Sequentially Truncated Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (ST-HOSVD) algorithm for
    computing the Tucker decomposition are presented. We show how the two primary com- putational
    kernels of the ST-HOSVD can be fused together into a single kernel to significantly improve
    memory locality. We then extend matrix tiling techniques to tensors to further improve cache
    utilization. This block-based approach is then coupled with a novel in-place transpose algorithm
    to drastically reduce the memory re- quirements of the algorithm by overwriting the original
    tensor with the result. Our approach's effectiveness is demonstrated by compar- ing the
    multi-threaded performance of our optimized ST-HOSVD algorithm to TuckerMPI, a state-of-the-art
    ST-HOSVD implemen- tation, in compressing two combustion simulation datasets. We demonstrate up
    to ~135x reduction in auxiliary memory consump- tion thereby increasing the problem size that
    can be computed for a given memory allocation by up to ~3x, whilst maintaining comparable
    runtime performance.},

## Welcome

Hello!

I am currently a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology co-advised by [Richard
Vuduc](https://vuduc.org/v2/){:target="\_blank"} and
[Haesun Park](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hpark/experiences.html){:target="\_blank"}. My research
focus is broadly on various forms of tensor decompositions for large-scale data analysis and compression.
Please check out the publications tab for the details of my work.

Previous to attending Georgia Tech, I attended Wake Forest University, where I received my Bachelor of
Sciencesâ€™ in Computer Science and Mathematical Business. To get in contact with me, feel
free to send me an email using the link below.

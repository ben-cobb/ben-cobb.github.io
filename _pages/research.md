Tensor Decompositions
----------

Tensor decompositions are the process of factoring a tensor into its component parts. Two of the most common decompositions are the [Candecomp/Parafac (CP)](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/tensor_decomposition_CP/){:target="\_blank"} and [Tucker](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/tensor_decomposition_tucker/){:target="\_blank"} decompositions. Thus far, my research has primarily focused on developing tensor kernels that can be used to compute the Tucker decomposition via an algorithm known as the Sequentiallly Truncated - Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition [(ST-HOSVD)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232708926_A_New_Truncation_Strategy_for_the_Higher-Order_Singular_Value_Decomposition){:target="\_blank"}. 

Applilications
-----------

Tensor decompositions, along with the ST-HOSVD, have broad applications in fields such as signal processing ... (add this in, plus link to citations...)

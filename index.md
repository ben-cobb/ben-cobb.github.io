Welcome
-----------
Hi! I am currently a PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Umit V. Catalyurek](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~umit/){:target="\_blank"}. Previous to attending Georgia Tech, I attended Wake Forest University, where I received my Bachelor of Sciences' in Computer Science and Mathematical Business. To get in contact with me, feel free to send me an email using the link below.

Research
-----------
My current research focuses on optimizing portable dense tensor kernels based upon the [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos){:target="\_blank"} programming model for use in [combustion simulation anomaly detection](https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1502973){:target="\_blank"}. This work is a part of [Sandia National Lab](https://www.sandia.gov/){:target="\_blank"}'s [GenTen](https://gitlab.com/tensors/genten){:target="\_blank"} project, which is a part of the [DOE](https://www.energy.gov/){:target="\_blank"}'s larger [Exascale Computing project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/){:target="\_blank"}. My undergraduate research primarily focused applying wedge-sampling heuristics to speeding up the coarsening phase hypergraph partitioners and applying bipartite matching algorithms to computing least-squares cosine differences of ktensors. This work was performed under the supervision of my undergraduate advisor and mentor, [Grey Ballard](http://users.wfu.edu/ballard/index.html){:target="\_blank"}. Please check out the research tab for more details pertaining to my research.

Work In Progress
----------------
This webpage is still in progress. Several pages on research and personal are coming in the next couple of days, so stay tuned!

<!-- Personal
-----------


passionate about improving the computational performance of tensor kernels. Please see research page for more details.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font
Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"}
and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"},
like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or
just disable all of them.
